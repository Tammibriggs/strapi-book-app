Knowledge of basic JavaScript will give you a good head start with the book. What You Will Learn Understand the ReactJS basics through an overview Install and create your first React component Refactor the ReactJS component using JSX Integrate your React application with the Facebook login and Graph API, then fetch data from your liked pages in Facebook and display them in a browser Handle UI elements events with React, respond to users input, and create stateful components Use some core lifecycle events for integration and find out about ES6 syntaxes in the React world Understand the FLUX architecture and create an application using FLUX with React Make a component more reusable with mixins and validation helpers and structure your components properly Explore techniques to test your ReactJS code Deploy your code using webpack and Gulp In Detail ReactJS, popularly known as the V (view) of the MVC architecture, was developed by the Facebook and Instagram developers. It follows a unidirectional data flow, virtual DOM, and DOM difference that are generously leveraged in order to increase the performance of the UI. Getting Started with React will help you implement the Reactive paradigm to build stateless and asynchronous apps with React. We will begin with an overview of ReactJS and its evolution over the years, followed by building a simple React component. We will then build the same react component with JSX syntax to demystify its usage. You will see how to configure the Facebook Graph API, get your likes list, and render it using React. Following this, we will break the UI into components and you'll learn how to establish communication between them and respond to users input/events in order to have the UI reflect their state. You'll also get to grips with the ES6 syntaxes. Moving ahead, we will delve into the FLUX and its architecture, which is used to build client-side web applications and complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow. Towards the end, you'll find out how to make your components reusable, and test and deploy them into a production environment. Finally, we'll briefly touch on other topics such as React on the server side, Redux and some advanced concepts. Style and approach The book follows a step-by-step, practical, tutorial approach with examples that explain the key concepts of ReactJS.

    description: "React jsThe Complete Beginner's Guide to React - 2nd Edition (2020)Facebook's React has changed the way we think about web applications and user interface development. Due to its design, you can use it beyond web. A feature known as the Virtual DOM enables this.In this chapter we'll go through some of the basic ideas behind the library so you understand React a little better before moving on.What is React?React is a JavaScript library that forces you to think in terms of components. This model of thinking fits user interfaces well. Depending on your background it might feel alien at first. You will have to think very carefully about the concept of state and where it belongs.Because state management is a difficult problem, a variety of solutions have appeared. In this book, we'll start by managing state ourselves and then push it to a Flux implementation known as Alt. There are also implementations available for several other alternatives, such as Redux, MobX, and Cerebral.React is pragmatic in the sense that it contains a set of escape hatches. If the React model doesn't work for you, it is still possible to revert back to something lower level. For instance, there are hooks that can be used to wrap older logic that relies on the DOM. This breaks the abstraction and ties your code to a specific environment, but sometimes that's the pragmatic thing to do.One of the fundamental problems of programming is how to deal with state. Suppose you are developing a user interface and want to show the same data in multiple places. How do you make sure the data is consistent?Historically we have mixed the concerns of the DOM and state and tried to manage it there. React solves this problem in a different way. It introduced the concept of the Virtual DOM to the masses.Virtual DOM exists on top of the actual DOM, or some other render target. It solves the state manipulation problem in its own way. Whenever changes are made to it, it figures out the best way to batch the changes to the underlying DOM structure. It is able to propagate changes across its virtual tree as in the image above.Virtual DOM PerformanceHandling the DOM manipulation this way can lead to increased performance. Manipulating the DOM by hand tends to be inefficient and is hard to optimize. By leaving the problem of DOM manipulation to a good implementation, you can save a lot of time and effort.React allows you to tune performance further by implementing hooks to adjust the way the virtual tree is updated. Though this is often an optional step.The biggest cost of Virtual DOM is that the implementation makes React quite big. You can expect the bundle sizes of small applications to be around 150-200 kB minified, React included. gzipping will help, but it's still big.",

    description: "In the present monograph, we develop the kinetic theory of transport phenomena and relaxation processes in the flows of reacting gas mixtures and discuss its applications to strongly non-equilibrium conditions. The main attention is focused on the influence of non-equilibrium kinetics on gas dynamics and transport properties. Closed systems of fluid dynamic equations are derived from the kinetic equations in different approaches. We consider the most accurate approach taking into account the state-to-state kinetics in a flow, as well as simplified multi-temperature and one-temperature models based on quasi-stationary distributions. Within these approaches, we propose the algorithms for the calculation of the transport coefficients and rate coefficients of chemical reactions and energy exchanges in non-equilibrium flows; the developed techniques are based on the fundamental kinetic theory principles. The theory is applied to the modeling of non-equilibrium flows behind strong shock waves, in the boundary layer, and in nozzles. The comparison of the results obtained within the frame of different approaches is presented, the advantages of the new state-to-state kinetic model are discussed, and the limits of validity for simplified models are established. The book can be interesting for scientists and graduate students working on physical gas dynamics, aerothermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, non-equilibrium physical-chemical kinetics, and kinetic theory of gases.",

    description: "In situ generation of species for crystal growth in solution is a relatively undeveloped, but promising technique for preparation of solid state material. In this work a solvent, liquid sulfur, generates species in solution by chemical reduction at high temperatures. Evaluation of this high temperature reduction agent included measurements of qualitative and kinetic parameters for the reactions molybdic oxide - sulfur and tungstic oxide - sulfur as a function of temperature, time, and atmosphere. Temperature effects on reduction rate over the range 125 to 400C were markedly non-linear. Reduction products isolated include Mo(IV) oxide at 250C; Mo(IV) sulfide at 400C; W(IV) sulfide at 400C. The oxidation product detected whenever reduced species were found was sulfur(IV) oxide. Additional evidence of species WO(x)S(y) and polymeric sulfur was found. Results of this study indicate that liquid sulfur can serve as a straightforward reducing agent at high temperatures. The rate or extent of such reduction is easily controlled by varying thermal conditions or duration of reaction, and the products of such reductions may be readily isolated by solution techniques which remove unreacted sulfur.",

You should, at the very least, page through that lesson to make sure you're familiar with those aspects of JavaScript.From there, we jump into React. You'll start off with a simple \"Hello, world!\" app, and then we'll begin walking you through creating a small, but featureful math app. This will give you the skills you need to build many different types of React applications.When reading this book, you should be sitting at your computer. When you first begin, plan to spend at least two uninterrupted hours. You should do your best to get through lesson 3 in the first sitting. That will get you through the foundational learning.

Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter and provides support for both iOS (including iPhone X screens) & Android. A Weather App - Get your feet wet with React Native by building a weather app allows the user to input their location and grabs weather data from a third party API. A Time Tracker - Brush up on your core React knowledge and build a time tracking app. A Messaging App - Understand how to use the core React Native APIs like Geolocation, CameraRoll, Keyboard, NetInfo and much more through completing a messaging app An Instagram Clone - Learn how to style your app, manage user input, add comments and display photos from Unsplash A Contacts App - Learn how to use Navigation: a major piece of any mobile application with multiple screens A Puzzle Game - Learn how to achieve smooth animations that render at 60 frames-per-second (fps) FAQHow long is the book? The book has 11 chapters totaling 670 pages, several sample apps totaling over 1000+ lines of code (JavaScript/JSX, non-comment lines). Do I have to know React? Nope! We've written the book so that it can be used even if you aren't familiar with React. Although, if you'd like to learn React in depth, checkout our other book Fullstack React Do I have to know JavaScript? Yes, we assume you know the basics of the language. But you don't need to be completely up-to-date: we teach the latest language features in case you're not familiar with them. However, this book teaches React Native from the ground up and you can use it even if you've never written a mobile app before.",

    description: "The two chapters in Volume 84 describe transition metal catalyzed processes that form carbon-carbon bonds and carbon-oxygen bonds in very interesting and practical ways. The first chapter authored by Christina Moberg describes an important subset of one of the earliest and most important enantioselective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions that employ transition metal complexes, namely molybdenum-catalyzed, asymmetric allylic alkylations. The second chapter authored by Brian W. Michel, Laura D. Steffens, and Matthew S. Sigman deals with one of the oldest examples of transition metal catalyzed oxidation, known as the Wacker process.",

    description: "Recently interest has arisen in the use of electrical discharges to effect chemical reactions. Various types of discharges enable us to alter the conditions of a process over a wide range, and often ro combine the high electron \"temperatures\" necessary to activ ate certainreactions with the low molecular temperatures of the medium used. This makes it possible to simplify the techniques and apparatus required for a process, and to \"quench\" the products, thus preventing them from decomposing again. Same work on the use of electrical discharges has already found practical applications, These include the preparation of oxides of nitrogen, hydrocyanic acid, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide, thickening of oils, synthesis of acetylene and its homologs, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of various oils and animal fats, etc, In the heavy organic-synthesis industry, lower olefins and acetylenes are used an a !arge scale as raw ma terials for producing many valuable products, Methods of producing ethylene, propylene, and butylenes from gaseous and liquid hydrocarbon feedstocks have been widely adopted. However, the production of acetylene which is an important and sometimes indispensable initial product-is mainly based an calcium carbide. De spite a number of recent improvements, this method of acetylene production suffers from high electric power consumption and expensive raw materials, requires several stages, and produces !arge amounts of waste products. V arious lines are being followed in the attempt to find new, more sophisticated means of producing acetylene.",

    description: "Explore global state management and select the best library for your application Key Features Understand the essential concepts and features of micro state management Discover solutions to common problems faced while implementing micro state management Explore the different libraries, their coding style, and the optimum approach to rendering optimization Book Description State management is one of the most complex concepts in React. Traditionally, developers have used monolithic state management solutions. Thanks to React Hooks, micro state management is something tuned for moving your application from a monolith to a microservice. This book provides a hands-on approach to the implementation of micro state management that will have you up and running and productive in no time. You'll learn basic patterns for state management in React and understand how to overcome the challenges encountered when you need to make the state global. Later chapters will show you how slicing a state into pieces is the way to overcome limitations. Using hooks, you'll see how you can easily reuse logic and have several solutions for specific domains, such as form state and server cache state. Finally, you'll explore how to use libraries such as Zustand, Jotai, and Valtio to organize state and manage development efficiently. By the end of this React book, you'll have learned how to choose the right global state management solution for your app requirement. What you will learn Understand micro state management and how you can deal with global state Build libraries using micro state management along with React Hooks Discover how micro approaches are easy using React Hooks Understand the difference between component state and module state Explore several approaches for implementing a global state Become well-versed with concrete examples and libraries such as Zustand, Jotai, and Valtio Who this book is for If you're a React developer dealing with complex global state management solutions and want to learn how to choose the best alternative based on your requirements, this book is for you.
